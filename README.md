Notes
------
This is my current virtual box setup. I initially configured this "rice" on a separate arch install, but now i just use it as a simple, functional, virtual test system to experiment with, for the sole purpose of learning linux. The config for alacritty needs to be migrated to .toml from .yml, although that is easily done through running the following command on the alacritty terminal: 
```
alacritty migrate
```
